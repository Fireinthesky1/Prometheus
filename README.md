 C Compiler Written in C

 -we want to write a compiler that compiles C code or some subset of C
 code into 6502 assembly language. We kind of basically hope we can target
 a specific machine such as umm idk maybe the commodor 64 or the apple 2.

* TODO
    - [] Lex source into tokens
    - [] Parse tokens into an abstract syntax tree
    - [] Compile AST into 6502 assembly
